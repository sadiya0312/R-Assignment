I was able to clone your repository and run the Rmd file easily.
the outcome files were correct. 

I see a missing data place holder but I do not see missing data in that place holder.

Very detailed examination of input files to better understand input size, dimensions, content, and missing data, and great presentation of the results.

Very clear and informative plots for SNP distribution between maize and teosinte.
